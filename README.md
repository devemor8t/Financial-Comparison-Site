# Financial-Comparison-Site
A no-code developed website to compare various metrics from stock, balance sheets, and income statements. 

I'm not a developer, but what I have is a particular set of 20 year old skills... and the patience to test out AI driven development to make something I could have spend a few more minutes googling or paid $10/month for. 

To use this, you will need to go to https://site.financialmodelingprep.com and get your (free or paid) API key. Then you will need to go into each HTML file and replace "###-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE-###" with your own API key.

If you are a developer, you can laugh at how bad (my) AI driven code is, and just know that I at least removed the style declaration from the header of each page and put it in the style sheet.

If you're not a developer - all you need to do is download the HTML files, edit them with a basic text editor or VScode to add your API key.
